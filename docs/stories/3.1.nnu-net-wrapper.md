# Story 3.1: Implement nnU-Net Wrapper Module

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** nnU-Net integration with sliding window processing,
**so that** real segmentation inference can be performed on uploaded volumes

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real tomogram runs end-to-end on GPU with nnU-Net v2
2. Sliding window processing handles large volumes efficiently
3. Dice score ≥0.85 on benchmark volumes
4. OOM handled gracefully with error message
5. Integration works with existing job orchestration

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Set up nnU-Net v2 environment (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Install nnU-Net v2 and dependencies
  - [ ] Configure GPU environment and CUDA setup
  - [ ] Set up model loading and initialization
  - [ ] Test basic nnU-Net functionality
- [ ] Task 2: Implement sliding window wrapper (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create sliding window processing logic
  - [ ] Implement volume chunking and reassembly
  - [ ] Add overlap handling for seamless results
  - [ ] Optimize memory usage during processing
- [ ] Task 3: Integrate with job orchestration (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Connect nnU-Net wrapper to job runner
  - [ ] Implement job parameter validation
  - [ ] Add progress reporting during inference
  - [ ] Handle job cancellation during processing
- [ ] Task 4: Add performance optimization (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Implement GPU memory management
  - [ ] Add batch processing optimization
  - [ ] Optimize sliding window parameters
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring and logging
- [ ] Task 5: Add error handling and validation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement OOM detection and graceful handling
  - [ ] Add input validation and preprocessing
  - [ ] Create error recovery mechanisms
  - [ ] Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Epic 2 provides upload and job management. This story adds real inference capability using nnU-Net.

### Data Models
**Job Record** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#job-record]:
- Tracks job_id, state, params, artifacts, errors
- Must include inference parameters and results

### API Specifications
**Jobs** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#jobs]:
- `POST /jobs` - must accept inference parameters
- `GET /jobs/{id}` - must report inference progress

### File Locations
**Inference Server** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#22-inference-server]:
- nnU-Net Runner (sliding window, periodic previews)
- Job Orchestrator (async queue) - integration with inference

### Technical Constraints
**Runtime Requirements** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- ≥24 GB VRAM GPU, 64 GB RAM, NVMe 1 TB
- One job/GPU concurrent in MVP

**Performance** [Source: architecture/6-runtime-design-concurrency.md#server]:
- Efficient GPU utilization and memory management
- Sliding window processing for large volumes

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Unit tests for nnU-Net wrapper
- Integration tests with job orchestration
- Performance testing with benchmark volumes
- Error handling and OOM testing
