# Story 2.3: Implement Job Cancellation and Error Handling

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** robust job cancellation and error handling,
**so that** users can cancel jobs and the system handles errors gracefully

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Cancelling a job mid-run works and updates state correctly
2. Error handling covers network, file, and processing errors
3. Cancelled jobs clean up resources properly
4. Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
5. System remains stable under error conditions

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement job cancellation flow (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Add cancellation request handling in job orchestrator
  - [ ] Implement graceful job termination and cleanup
  - [ ] Update job state to cancelled and notify clients
  - [ ] Clean up temporary files and resources
- [ ] Task 2: Add comprehensive error handling (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Implement error categorization (network, file, processing)
  - [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms where possible
  - [ ] Create error logging and monitoring
  - [ ] Handle system-level errors gracefully
- [ ] Task 3: Implement user-friendly error messages (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create error message templates and localization
  - [ ] Add actionable error hints and suggestions
  - [ ] Implement error code mapping and descriptions
  - [ ] Provide retry guidance where appropriate
- [ ] Task 4: Add resource cleanup and management (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Implement proper resource cleanup on cancellation
  - [ ] Add timeout handling for stuck jobs
  - [ ] Create orphaned job detection and cleanup
  - [ ] Implement resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Task 5: Add error testing and validation (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create error scenario testing
  - [ ] Test cancellation under various conditions
  - [ ] Validate error message clarity and usefulness
  - [ ] Test system stability under error conditions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 2.1-2.2 provide upload and job management. This story adds robustness through cancellation and error handling.

### Data Models
**Job Record** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#job-record]:
- Tracks job_id, state, params, artifacts, errors
- Error field must capture detailed error information

**Error Model** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#error-model]:
- JSON envelope with code, message, hint, retryable

### API Specifications
**Jobs** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#jobs]:
- `DELETE /jobs/{id}` (cancel) - must handle cancellation gracefully

**Error Model** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#error-model]:
- JSON envelope with code, message, hint, retryable

### File Locations
**Server Components** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#22-inference-server]:
- Job Orchestrator (async queue) - cancellation and error handling
- Artifact Manager - cleanup of job artifacts

### Technical Constraints
**Error & Recovery** [Source: architecture/3-data-flow-interactions.md#35-error-recovery]:
- Proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Graceful degradation under error conditions

**Security** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#security]:
- No raw data in logs
- Proper error message sanitization

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Error scenario testing
- Cancellation flow testing
- Resource cleanup validation
- System stability testing under errors
