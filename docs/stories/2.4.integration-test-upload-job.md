# Story 2.4: Integration Test - Upload and Fake Job Flow

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** comprehensive integration testing for upload and job flow,
**so that** I can validate the complete upload-to-job pipeline works correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Integration test covers complete upload + fake job workflow
2. Test validates chunked upload with resume capability
3. Test verifies job creation, execution, and completion
4. Test covers error scenarios and edge cases
5. Test performance meets requirements for large files

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create end-to-end upload test (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Test chunked upload of large file (10GB target)
  - [ ] Test upload resume after interruption
  - [ ] Test file integrity validation
  - [ ] Test upload progress tracking
- [ ] Task 2: Create job workflow integration test (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Test job creation from uploaded file
  - [ ] Test job state transitions (queued → running → completed)
  - [ ] Test fake inference processing
  - [ ] Test job completion and artifact generation
- [ ] Task 3: Add error scenario testing (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test upload failures and recovery
  - [ ] Test job cancellation mid-execution
  - [ ] Test network interruption handling
  - [ ] Test invalid file handling
- [ ] Task 4: Add performance and load testing (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Test upload performance with large files
  - [ ] Test concurrent upload handling
  - [ ] Test job queue performance under load
  - [ ] Test memory usage during large file processing
- [ ] Task 5: Create test automation and reporting (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Set up automated test execution
  - [ ] Create test result reporting and metrics
  - [ ] Add test data management and cleanup
  - [ ] Document test scenarios and expected results

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 2.1-2.3 provide upload, job management, and error handling. This story validates the complete integration.

### Data Models
**Complete Data Flow** [Source: architecture/3-data-flow-interactions.md]:
- Upload Flow: chunked upload → file assembly → integrity check
- Job Lifecycle: job creation → queued → running → completed

**Upload Session & File Record** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#upload-session-file-record]:
- Upload tracked by upload_id; assembled into FileRecord

**Job Record** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#job-record]:
- Tracks job_id, state, params, artifacts, errors

### API Specifications
**Complete API Integration** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md]:
- Uploads: `POST /uploads/init`, `PUT /uploads/{id}/part/{idx}`, `POST /uploads/{id}/complete`
- Jobs: `POST /jobs`, `GET /jobs/{id}`, `DELETE /jobs/{id}`

### File Locations
**End-to-End Testing** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Performance testing and monitoring

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- 10 GB file upload capability
- Efficient processing and memory management

**Error Handling** [Source: architecture/3-data-flow-interactions.md#35-error-recovery]:
- Comprehensive error scenario testing
- Recovery mechanism validation

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- End-to-end integration testing
- Performance and load testing
- Error scenario validation
- Automated test execution and reporting
