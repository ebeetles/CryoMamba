# Story 5.2: Implement Error Flows and Recovery

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** comprehensive error handling and recovery flows,
**so that** the system remains stable and recoverable under error conditions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Cancels, disconnects, and resumable uploads work reliably
2. Error recovery flows handle network, file, and processing errors
3. System remains stable under error conditions
4. User-friendly error messages and recovery guidance
5. Error logging and monitoring provides debugging information

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement upload error recovery (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add upload retry logic and resume capability
  - [ ] Handle network interruption and reconnection
  - [ ] Implement upload timeout and error handling
  - [ ] Add upload progress recovery and validation
- [ ] Task 2: Add WebSocket error handling (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Implement WebSocket reconnection logic
  - [ ] Handle connection drops and recovery
  - [ ] Add message loss detection and recovery
  - [ ] Create graceful degradation for connection issues
- [ ] Task 3: Implement job error recovery (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Add job failure detection and handling
  - [ ] Implement job retry and recovery mechanisms
  - [ ] Handle GPU errors and resource failures
  - [ ] Add job state recovery and cleanup
- [ ] Task 4: Add user-friendly error handling (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create clear error messages and user guidance
  - [ ] Implement error recovery suggestions and actions
  - [ ] Add error reporting and feedback mechanisms
  - [ ] Create error prevention and validation
- [ ] Task 5: Add error monitoring and logging (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive error logging
  - [ ] Add error monitoring and alerting
  - [ ] Create error analytics and reporting
  - [ ] Add debugging tools and error analysis

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 5.1 provides integration testing. This story adds comprehensive error handling and recovery.

### Data Models
**Error Model** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#error-model]:
- JSON envelope with code, message, hint, retryable
- Must be consistently applied across all error scenarios

**Job Record** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#job-record]:
- Tracks job_id, state, params, artifacts, errors
- Error field must capture detailed error information

### API Specifications
**Error Model** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#error-model]:
- JSON envelope with code, message, hint, retryable
- Consistent error handling across all endpoints

**Error & Recovery** [Source: architecture/3-data-flow-interactions.md#35-error-recovery]:
- Proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Graceful degradation under error conditions

### File Locations
**System-wide Error Handling** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- JSON logs for debugging
- Error monitoring and alerting
- Comprehensive error logging

### Technical Constraints
**Error & Recovery** [Source: architecture/3-data-flow-interactions.md#35-error-recovery]:
- Comprehensive error scenario handling
- Recovery mechanism validation
- Graceful degradation under error conditions

**Security** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#security]:
- No raw data in logs
- Proper error message sanitization

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Error scenario testing
- Recovery mechanism validation
- System stability testing under errors
- Error logging and monitoring testing
