# Story 3.3: Implement GPU Orchestrator (Single-GPU)

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** GPU job scheduling and resource management,
**so that** inference jobs are efficiently managed on GPU hardware

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GPU scheduling handles 1 job/GPU concurrent execution
2. GPU resource monitoring and management works correctly
3. Job queuing and prioritization functions properly
4. GPU memory management prevents OOM errors
5. System handles GPU unavailability gracefully

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement GPU resource monitoring (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create GPU memory and utilization monitoring
  - [ ] Add GPU availability detection and health checks
  - [ ] Implement resource usage tracking and reporting
  - [ ] Add GPU performance metrics collection
- [ ] Task 2: Create GPU job scheduler (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Implement single-GPU job scheduling
  - [ ] Add job queuing and priority management
  - [ ] Create job execution and resource allocation
  - [ ] Implement job completion and resource cleanup
- [ ] Task 3: Add GPU memory management (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement GPU memory allocation and deallocation
  - [ ] Add memory usage monitoring and limits
  - [ ] Create memory cleanup on job completion/cancellation
  - [ ] Implement memory fragmentation handling
- [ ] Task 4: Implement error handling and recovery (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add GPU unavailability detection and handling
  - [ ] Implement job failure recovery mechanisms
  - [ ] Create GPU error reporting and logging
  - [ ] Add graceful degradation when GPU unavailable
- [ ] Task 5: Add performance optimization (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Optimize GPU utilization and throughput
  - [ ] Implement job batching where appropriate
  - [ ] Add GPU warm-up and initialization
  - [ ] Monitor and optimize GPU performance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 3.1-3.2 provide nnU-Net inference and preview streaming. This story adds GPU resource management.

### Data Models
**Job Record** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#job-record]:
- Tracks job_id, state, params, artifacts, errors
- Must include GPU resource allocation information

### API Specifications
**Jobs** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#jobs]:
- `POST /jobs` - must handle GPU resource allocation
- `GET /jobs/{id}` - must report GPU resource usage

### File Locations
**Inference Server** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#22-inference-server]:
- Job Orchestrator (async queue) - GPU scheduling and management
- nnU-Net Runner - GPU resource utilization

### Technical Constraints
**Runtime Requirements** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- â‰¥24 GB VRAM GPU, 64 GB RAM, NVMe 1 TB
- One job/GPU concurrent in MVP

**Performance** [Source: architecture/6-runtime-design-concurrency.md#server]:
- Efficient GPU utilization and job scheduling
- Proper resource management and cleanup

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- GPU resource monitoring testing
- Job scheduling and queuing testing
- Memory management and OOM testing
- Error handling and recovery testing
