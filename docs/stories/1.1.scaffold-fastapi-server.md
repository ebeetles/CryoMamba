# Story 1.1: Scaffold FastAPI Server Foundation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a basic FastAPI server with health endpoints and dummy job processing,
**so that** I have a foundation to build the inference server upon

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `uvicorn app.main:app` runs locally with `/healthz` returning OK
2. Server responds to basic health checks
3. Dummy job route accepts requests and returns mock responses
4. Server runs on CPU with no GPU required
5. Basic project structure follows architecture specifications

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create FastAPI project structure (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create `app/` directory with `__init__.py`
  - [ ] Create `app/main.py` with FastAPI app instance
  - [ ] Create `app/routes/` directory structure
  - [ ] Create `app/models/` directory for data models
- [ ] Task 2: Implement health endpoints (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create `app/routes/health.py` with `/v1/healthz` endpoint
  - [ ] Create `app/routes/info.py` with `/v1/server/info` endpoint
  - [ ] Register routes in main app
- [ ] Task 3: Implement dummy job processing (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create `app/routes/jobs.py` with basic job endpoints
  - [ ] Create `app/models/job.py` with JobRecord schema
  - [ ] Implement `POST /jobs` endpoint returning mock job_id
  - [ ] Implement `GET /jobs/{id}` endpoint returning mock status
- [ ] Task 4: Add basic configuration and error handling (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create `app/config.py` for environment variables
  - [ ] Add basic error handling middleware
  - [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with FastAPI dependencies
- [ ] Task 5: Create development setup (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `Dockerfile` for containerization
  - [ ] Create `docker-compose.yml` for local development
  - [ ] Create `README.md` with setup instructions
  - [ ] Add `.env.example` file

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the first story in Epic 1.

### Data Models
**JobRecord Schema** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#job-record]:
- Tracks job_id, state, params, artifacts, errors
- State should include: pending, running, completed, failed
- Basic structure needed for dummy implementation

### API Specifications
**Health Endpoints** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#health-info]:
- `/v1/healthz` - basic health check returning OK status
- `/v1/server/info` - server information endpoint

**Job Endpoints** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#jobs]:
- `POST /jobs` - create new job, return job_id
- `GET /jobs/{id}` - get job status and details
- `DELETE /jobs/{id}` - cancel job (for future implementation)

**Error Model** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#error-model]:
- JSON envelope with code, message, hint, retryable fields

### File Locations
**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#22-inference-server]:
- API Layer (FastAPI) - main application entry point
- Job Orchestrator (async queue) - basic structure for future
- Artifact Manager - basic structure for future

**Infrastructure** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#deployment-units]:
- Server Container (CUDA base) - Dockerfile needed
- Config & Secrets - environment variables for paths and settings

### Technical Constraints
**Runtime Requirements** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- Must run on CPU for MVP (no GPU required)
- Local dev environment setup
- Container-based deployment ready

**Security** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#security]:
- HTTPS ready (TLS termination at reverse proxy)
- Basic error handling without exposing sensitive data

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- JSON logs for debugging
- Basic health check validation
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for dummy job flow
