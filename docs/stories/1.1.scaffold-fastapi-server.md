# Story 1.1: Scaffold FastAPI Server Foundation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a basic FastAPI server with health endpoints and dummy job processing,
**so that** I have a foundation to build the inference server upon

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `uvicorn app.main:app` runs locally with `/healthz` returning OK
2. Server responds to basic health checks
3. Dummy job route accepts requests and returns mock responses
4. Server runs on CPU with no GPU required
5. Basic project structure follows architecture specifications

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the first story in Epic 1.

### Data Models
**JobRecord Schema** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#job-record]:
- Tracks job_id, state, params, artifacts, errors
- State should include: pending, running, completed, failed
- Basic structure needed for dummy implementation

### API Specifications
**Health Endpoints** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#health-info]:
- `/v1/healthz` - basic health check returning OK status
- `/v1/server/info` - server information endpoint

**Job Endpoints** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#jobs]:
- `POST /jobs` - create new job, return job_id
- `GET /jobs/{id}` - get job status and details
- `DELETE /jobs/{id}` - cancel job (for future implementation)

**Error Model** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#error-model]:
- JSON envelope with code, message, hint, retryable fields

### File Locations
**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#22-inference-server]:
- API Layer (FastAPI) - main application entry point
- Job Orchestrator (async queue) - basic structure for future
- Artifact Manager - basic structure for future

**Infrastructure** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#deployment-units]:
- Server Container (CUDA base) - Dockerfile needed
- Config & Secrets - environment variables for paths and settings

### Technical Constraints
**Runtime Requirements** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- Must run on CPU for MVP (no GPU required)
- Local dev environment setup
- Container-based deployment ready

**Security** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#security]:
- HTTPS ready (TLS termination at reverse proxy)
- Basic error handling without exposing sensitive data

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- JSON logs for debugging
- Basic health check validation
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for dummy job flow

## Dev Agent Record
*This section will be populated by the development agent during implementation*

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (via Cursor)

### Debug Log References
- Fixed pydantic BaseSettings import issue by switching to manual environment variable handling
- Resolved Python 3.13 compatibility issues with pydantic-core by using pre-built wheels
- Updated pydantic model configuration to use ConfigDict instead of deprecated class-based config

### Completion Notes List

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-13

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - The implementation demonstrates solid FastAPI fundamentals with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and good test coverage. The code is clean, well-documented, and follows Python best practices.

**Strengths:**
- Clean architecture with proper separation of routes, models, and configuration
- Comprehensive error handling middleware with proper JSON error responses
- Good use of Pydantic models with proper validation
- Extensive test coverage with integration tests
- Proper logging throughout the application
- Docker containerization ready for deployment

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `app/routes/health.py`
  - **Change**: Replaced `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now()` for consistency
  - **Why**: `utcnow()` is deprecated in Python 3.12+, `now()` is the recommended approach
  - **How**: Improves future compatibility and follows current Python standards

- **File**: `app/routes/jobs.py`
  - **Change**: Replaced `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now()` in two locations
  - **Why**: Consistency with Python 3.12+ recommendations and deprecation warnings
  - **How**: Ensures long-term compatibility and removes deprecation warnings

- **File**: `app/config.py`
  - **Change**: Replaced `eval()` with `json.loads()` for CORS origins parsing
  - **Why**: `eval()` is a security risk and should never be used for parsing user input
  - **How**: Uses safe JSON parsing with proper error handling, preventing code injection vulnerabilities

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to Python/FastAPI best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect separation of concerns with proper package organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive integration tests covering all endpoints and edge cases
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` usage (app/routes/health.py, app/routes/jobs.py)
- [x] Replaced unsafe `eval()` with secure `json.loads()` (app/config.py)
- [x] Added proper error handling for JSON parsing (app/config.py)
- [ ] Consider adding request validation middleware for input sanitization
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware for production readiness
- [ ] Consider adding OpenAPI documentation enhancements

### Security Review

**Status: GOOD** - Basic security practices implemented with room for production hardening.

**Findings:**
- ✅ Proper error handling without information leakage
- ✅ Safe JSON parsing implemented (fixed eval vulnerability)
- ✅ CORS properly configured for development
- ⚠️ No rate limiting (acceptable for MVP, needed for production)
- ⚠️ No input validation middleware (acceptable for dummy endpoints)

**Recommendations:**
- Add rate limiting before production deployment
- Consider input validation middleware for future real endpoints

### Performance Considerations

**Status: EXCELLENT** - Well-optimized for the current scope.

**Findings:**
- ✅ Efficient in-memory storage for dummy implementation
- ✅ Proper async/await usage throughout
- ✅ Minimal dependencies and lightweight implementation
- ✅ Fast startup time with uvicorn

**No performance issues identified for current MVP scope.**

### Files Modified During Review

- `app/routes/health.py` - Fixed deprecated datetime usage
- `app/routes/jobs.py` - Fixed deprecated datetime usage  
- `app/config.py` - Replaced eval() with secure JSON parsing

*Note: Dev should update File List to include these modifications*
