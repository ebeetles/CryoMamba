# Story 2.2: Implement Job State Machine and Orchestrator

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a job state machine with orchestrator for managing job lifecycle,
**so that** jobs can be properly tracked and managed through their execution phases

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Job records persist correctly with proper state transitions
2. Jobs transition through queued → running → completed states
3. In-memory job queue with fake inference works
4. Job state is properly tracked and queryable
5. Job orchestration handles concurrent job management

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Implement Job Record data model (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Create Job Record schema with state, params, artifacts, errors
  - [x] Define job state enumeration (queued, running, completed, failed, cancelled)
  - [x] Add job metadata tracking (creation time, duration, etc.)
  - [x] Implement job persistence and retrieval
- [x] Task 2: Create job state machine (AC: 2)
  - [x] Implement state transition logic and validation
  - [x] Add state change event handling and notifications
  - [x] Create state transition logging and audit trail
  - [x] Handle invalid state transitions gracefully
- [x] Task 3: Implement job orchestrator (AC: 3, 5)
  - [x] Create in-memory job queue with priority handling
  - [x] Implement job scheduling and execution management
  - [x] Add fake inference processing for testing
  - [x] Handle concurrent job execution limits
- [x] Task 4: Add job API endpoints (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Implement `POST /jobs` for job creation
  - [x] Create `GET /jobs/{id}` for job status and details
  - [x] Add `DELETE /jobs/{id}` for job cancellation
  - [x] Implement job listing and filtering endpoints
- [x] Task 5: Add job monitoring and error handling (AC: 2)
  - [x] Implement job progress tracking and reporting
  - [x] Add error handling and failure state management
  - [ ] Create job timeout handling and cleanup
  - [x] Add comprehensive job logging and monitoring

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.1 provides upload capability. This story adds job management that processes uploaded files.

### Data Models
**Job Record** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#job-record]:
- Tracks job_id, state, params, artifacts, errors
- State transitions: queued → running → completed (with error/cancel states)

### API Specifications
**Jobs** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#jobs]:
- `POST /jobs` (create), `GET /jobs/{id}` (status), `DELETE /jobs/{id}` (cancel)

**Error Model** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#error-model]:
- JSON envelope with code, message, hint, retryable

### File Locations
**Server Components** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#22-inference-server]:
- Job Orchestrator (async queue) - job management and execution
- Artifact Manager - job artifacts and results

### Technical Constraints
**Runtime Design** [Source: architecture/6-runtime-design-concurrency.md#server]:
- Efficient job queue management
- Proper concurrency handling for job execution

**Performance** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- One job/GPU concurrent in MVP
- Efficient job state tracking and persistence

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Unit tests for job state machine
- Integration tests for job orchestration
- Concurrency testing for job queue
- Error handling and state transition testing
