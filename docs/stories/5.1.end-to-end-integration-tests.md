# Story 5.1: Implement End-to-End Integration Tests

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** comprehensive end-to-end integration tests,
**so that** I can validate the complete system works correctly from upload to export

## Acceptance Criteria
1. End-to-end tests cover complete upload → inference → preview → export workflow
2. Tests validate all major system components working together
3. Tests cover error scenarios and edge cases
4. Test performance meets requirements for large files
5. Tests are automated and provide clear pass/fail results

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create complete workflow integration test (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Test full upload → job creation → inference → preview → export flow
  - [ ] Validate all API endpoints and WebSocket communication
  - [ ] Test desktop-server integration and data flow
  - [ ] Verify artifact generation and access
- [ ] Task 2: Add error scenario testing (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Test upload failures and recovery
  - [ ] Test job cancellation and error handling
  - [ ] Test network interruption and reconnection
  - [ ] Test invalid input and edge case handling
- [ ] Task 3: Implement performance testing (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test with large files (10GB+ volumes)
  - [ ] Validate performance requirements and benchmarks
  - [ ] Test concurrent job handling
  - [ ] Monitor memory usage and resource utilization
- [ ] Task 4: Add test automation and reporting (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Set up automated test execution pipeline
  - [ ] Create comprehensive test result reporting
  - [ ] Add test metrics and performance monitoring
  - [ ] Implement test failure analysis and debugging
- [ ] Task 5: Create test data and environment management (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Set up test data sets and sample volumes
  - [ ] Create isolated test environments
  - [ ] Add test data cleanup and management
  - [ ] Document test scenarios and expected results

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Epics 1-4 provide all system components. This story validates the complete integration.

### Data Models
**Complete Data Flow** [Source: architecture/3-data-flow-interactions.md]:
- End-to-End Happy Path: upload → job → inference → preview → export
- Upload Flow: chunked upload → file assembly → integrity check
- Job Lifecycle: job creation → queued → running → completed
- Preview Streaming: real-time preview updates during inference

### API Specifications
**Complete API Integration** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md]:
- Health & Info: `/v1/healthz`, `/v1/server/info`
- Uploads: `POST /uploads/init`, `PUT /uploads/{id}/part/{idx}`, `POST /uploads/{id}/complete`
- Jobs: `POST /jobs`, `GET /jobs/{id}`, `DELETE /jobs/{id}`
- WebSocket: `/ws/jobs/{id}` for preview streaming
- Artifacts: Signed GET `/files/{job}/{artifact}`

### File Locations
**End-to-End Testing** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Performance testing and monitoring

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- 10 GB file upload capability
- Efficient processing and memory management
- Real-time preview streaming

**Error Handling** [Source: architecture/3-data-flow-interactions.md#35-error-recovery]:
- Comprehensive error scenario testing
- Recovery mechanism validation

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- End-to-end integration testing
- Performance and load testing
- Error scenario validation
- Automated test execution and reporting
