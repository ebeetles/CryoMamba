# Story 5.3: Implement PyInstaller Build and Packaging

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** PyInstaller build and packaging for macOS desktop app,
**so that** users can install and run the application without developer tools

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `.app` launches without developer tools or Python installation
2. PyInstaller build includes all required dependencies
3. Application bundle is properly signed (if certificates available)
4. Build process is automated and reproducible
5. Application performance is acceptable in packaged form

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Set up PyInstaller build configuration (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Create PyInstaller spec file with proper configuration
  - [ ] Configure dependency inclusion and exclusion
  - [ ] Set up build scripts and automation
  - [ ] Add build environment setup and validation
- [ ] Task 2: Implement macOS app bundle creation (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create proper macOS app bundle structure
  - [ ] Add application metadata and Info.plist
  - [ ] Implement code signing (if certificates available)
  - [ ] Add notarization support for macOS distribution
- [ ] Task 3: Add dependency management and optimization (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Optimize dependency inclusion and size
  - [ ] Add runtime dependency validation
  - [ ] Implement lazy loading for large dependencies
  - [ ] Optimize application startup time
- [ ] Task 4: Create build automation and CI/CD (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Set up automated build pipeline
  - [ ] Add build testing and validation
  - [ ] Implement build artifact management
  - [ ] Add build failure notification and debugging
- [ ] Task 5: Add installation and distribution support (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create installer package (DMG or PKG)
  - [ ] Add installation validation and testing
  - [ ] Implement update mechanism and versioning
  - [ ] Add uninstallation and cleanup support

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 5.1-5.2 provide testing and error handling. This story adds production packaging.

### Data Models
No specific data models required - this is packaging and distribution.

### API Specifications
No API changes required - this is client-side packaging.

### File Locations
**Desktop Packaging** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#deployment-units]:
- Desktop Packaging (PyInstaller .app)
- Codesigning (if available)

**CI/CD** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#cicd]:
- GitHub Actions for CPU tests, GPU build on self-hosted runner
- Desktop notarization pipeline

### Technical Constraints
**Deployment** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#deployment-units]:
- PyInstaller .app build for macOS
- Proper code signing and notarization

**Performance** [Source: architecture/6-runtime-design-concurrency.md#desktop]:
- Application must perform well in packaged form
- Efficient startup and runtime performance

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Build process testing and validation
- Application functionality testing in packaged form
- Installation and distribution testing
- Performance testing in packaged environment
