# Story 4.3: Implement Export Menu and Functions

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** export functionality for masks and visualizations,
**so that** users can save their results in various formats

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Export functions produce valid `.mrc` and `.png` files
2. Multiple export formats supported (mask.mrc, NIfTI, PNG screenshots)
3. Export includes proper metadata and scale information
4. Screenshot export includes scale bar and annotations
5. Export performance is acceptable for large volumes

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement mask export functionality (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create mask.mrc export with proper voxel alignment
  - [ ] Add metadata preservation and scale information
  - [ ] Implement file validation and integrity checks
  - [ ] Add export progress indication and error handling
- [ ] Task 2: Add multiple format support (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Implement NIfTI export using nibabel
  - [ ] Add NRRD export using pynrrd
  - [ ] Create format conversion and validation
  - [ ] Add format-specific metadata handling
- [ ] Task 3: Implement screenshot export (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Create PNG screenshot capture from napari viewer
  - [ ] Add scale bar rendering and positioning
  - [ ] Implement annotation and metadata overlay
  - [ ] Add high-resolution export options
- [ ] Task 4: Create export menu and UI (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add export menu to main application
  - [ ] Create export dialog with format selection
  - [ ] Add export options and settings
  - [ ] Implement export progress and status display
- [ ] Task 5: Add export optimization (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Optimize export performance for large volumes
  - [ ] Implement export caching and compression
  - [ ] Add export queue management for multiple exports
  - [ ] Create export monitoring and logging

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 4.1-4.2 provide visualization controls and WebSocket integration. This story adds export functionality.

### Data Models
**Artifact Stats** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#artifact-stats]:
- JSON of label voxel counts, physical volume, surface area
- Should be included in export metadata

**Desktop Application** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#21-desktop-application]:
- I/O: `mrcfile` for reading/writing; nibabel/pynrrd for export

### API Specifications
**Artifacts** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#artifacts]:
- Signed GET `/files/{job}/{artifact}` - for server-side artifact access
- Client-side export complements server artifacts

### File Locations
**Desktop Application** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#21-desktop-application]:
- I/O: `mrcfile` for reading/writing; nibabel/pynrrd for export
- UI: Qt menus, dialogs, status bar

### Technical Constraints
**Performance** [Source: architecture/6-runtime-design-concurrency.md#desktop]:
- Efficient export processing for large volumes
- Proper memory management during export

**Data Flow** [Source: architecture/3-data-flow-interactions.md#33-job-lifecycle]:
- Export must maintain voxel alignment with source volume
- Proper metadata and scale information preservation

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Export format validation testing
- Performance testing with large volumes
- Metadata preservation testing
- UI functionality and error handling testing
