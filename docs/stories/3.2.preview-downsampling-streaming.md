## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 provides nnU-Net inference. This story adds real-time preview streaming during inference.

### Data Models
**Preview Message** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#preview-message]:
- JSON with scale, shape, dtype, base64 payload
- Must be efficiently streamable and displayable

### API Specifications
**WebSocket** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#websocket]:
- `/ws/jobs/{id}`: progress, preview, completed, error messages
- Low latency streaming for real-time updates

**Protocols** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#23-protocols]:
- Previews: WebSocket for low latency streaming

### File Locations
**Inference Server** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#22-inference-server]:
- nnU-Net Runner (sliding window, periodic previews)
- Job Orchestrator (async queue) - preview scheduling

**Desktop Application** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#21-desktop-application]:
- Networking: WebSocket for streaming previews
- Data Structures: Mask overlay layers

### Technical Constraints
**Performance** [Source: architecture/6-runtime-design-concurrency.md#server]:
- Efficient preview generation and streaming
- Low latency WebSocket delivery

**Runtime Requirements** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- Real-time preview streaming at 1-2 second intervals
- Efficient downsampling and compression

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Preview streaming performance testing
- WebSocket latency and reliability testing
- Preview quality validation
- Desktop integration testing
