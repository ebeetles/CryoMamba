# Story 2.1: Implement Chunked Upload Pipeline

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** chunked upload endpoints with resume capability,
**so that** large .mrc files can be uploaded reliably even with network interruptions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. 10 GB file can upload in chunks with proper chunk management
2. Upload can resume after interruption using existing chunks
3. File assembly and integrity check works correctly
4. API responses match Section 7 of architecture doc
5. Upload progress tracking and status reporting

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement upload initialization (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Create `POST /uploads/init` endpoint
  - [ ] Generate unique upload_id and session tracking
  - [ ] Validate file metadata and size limits
  - [ ] Return upload session details to client
- [ ] Task 2: Implement chunked upload handling (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create `PUT /uploads/{id}/part/{idx}` endpoint
  - [ ] Handle chunk validation and storage
  - [ ] Implement chunk deduplication and resume logic
  - [ ] Add progress tracking and status updates
- [ ] Task 3: Implement file assembly and completion (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create `POST /uploads/{id}/complete` endpoint
  - [ ] Assemble chunks into complete file
  - [ ] Perform integrity checks (checksum validation)
  - [ ] Clean up temporary chunk files
- [ ] Task 4: Add upload session management (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create Upload Session & File Record data models
  - [ ] Implement session persistence and state tracking
  - [ ] Add session cleanup and timeout handling
  - [ ] Implement upload cancellation functionality
- [ ] Task 5: Add error handling and validation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement proper error responses per architecture
  - [ ] Add file type and size validation
  - [ ] Handle network errors and retry logic
  - [ ] Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Epic 1 provides the foundation server and desktop. This story adds the upload capability that feeds into job processing.

### Data Models
**Upload Session & File Record** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#upload-session-file-record]:
- Upload tracked by upload_id; assembled into FileRecord
- Must track chunk status, progress, and completion state

### API Specifications
**Uploads** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#uploads]:
- `POST /uploads/init` - initialize upload session
- `PUT /uploads/{id}/part/{idx}` - upload individual chunks
- `POST /uploads/{id}/complete` - finalize upload

**Protocols** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#23-protocols]:
- Upload: HTTP PUT (chunked) for reliable large transfer

**Error Model** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#error-model]:
- JSON envelope with code, message, hint, retryable

### File Locations
**Server Components** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#22-inference-server]:
- API Layer (FastAPI) - upload endpoint implementation
- Artifact Manager - file storage and management

**Infrastructure** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#config-secrets]:
- Config & Secrets - file paths and storage settings

### Technical Constraints
**Performance** [Source: architecture/6-runtime-design-concurrency.md#upload]:
- Efficient chunk handling for large files
- Proper memory management during assembly

**Security** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#security]:
- HTTPS, JWT bearer, signed URLs
- No raw data in logs

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Unit tests for upload endpoints
- Integration tests for chunked upload flow
- Performance testing with large files
- Error handling and resume testing
