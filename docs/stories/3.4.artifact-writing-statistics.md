# Story 3.4: Implement Artifact Writing and Statistics

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** artifact generation and statistics calculation,
**so that** completed jobs produce usable outputs with metadata

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Artifacts written atomically and accessible via signed URLs
2. Final mask aligned to source volume voxel-to-voxel
3. Artifact stats include label voxel counts, physical volume, surface area
4. Multiple output formats supported (mask.mrc, NIfTI, NRRD)
5. Artifact cleanup and management works correctly

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement artifact writing system (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create atomic artifact writing with proper alignment
  - [ ] Implement mask.mrc output with correct voxel alignment
  - [ ] Add file integrity validation and checksums
  - [ ] Create artifact metadata and indexing
- [ ] Task 2: Add multiple output format support (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement NIfTI export using nibabel
  - [ ] Add NRRD export using pynrrd
  - [ ] Create format conversion and validation
  - [ ] Add format-specific metadata handling
- [ ] Task 3: Implement statistics calculation (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Calculate label voxel counts and distributions
  - [ ] Compute physical volume measurements
  - [ ] Add surface area calculations
  - [ ] Create comprehensive artifact statistics
- [ ] Task 4: Add signed URL access (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement artifact access control and authentication
  - [ ] Create signed URL generation for artifact access
  - [ ] Add URL expiration and security controls
  - [ ] Implement artifact download and streaming
- [ ] Task 5: Add artifact management and cleanup (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement artifact lifecycle management
  - [ ] Add artifact cleanup and garbage collection
  - [ ] Create artifact backup and archival
  - [ ] Add artifact monitoring and reporting

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 3.1-3.3 provide inference, preview streaming, and GPU management. This story adds artifact generation and management.

### Data Models
**Artifact Stats** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#artifact-stats]:
- JSON of label voxel counts, physical volume, surface area
- Must be calculated and stored with each artifact

**Job Record** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#job-record]:
- Tracks job_id, state, params, artifacts, errors
- Must include artifact references and metadata

### API Specifications
**Artifacts** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#artifacts]:
- Signed GET `/files/{job}/{artifact}` - secure artifact access

**Security** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#security]:
- HTTPS, JWT bearer, signed URLs
- Secure artifact access and delivery

### File Locations
**Inference Server** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#22-inference-server]:
- Artifact Manager (mask.mrc, NIfTI, NRRD, stats.json)
- Job Orchestrator - artifact lifecycle management

### Technical Constraints
**Data Flow** [Source: architecture/3-data-flow-interactions.md#33-job-lifecycle]:
- Artifact generation and alignment with source volume
- Proper voxel-to-voxel correspondence

**Security** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#security]:
- Signed URLs for secure artifact access
- Proper access control and authentication

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Artifact generation and validation testing
- Statistics calculation accuracy testing
- Signed URL access and security testing
- Artifact cleanup and management testing
