# Story 1.4: Create Dockerfile and Local Development Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** Docker containerization and local development setup,
**so that** I can easily run and test the server in a consistent environment

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dockerfile builds successfully and runs the FastAPI server
2. docker-compose.yml enables local development with proper networking
3. Server runs on CPU with no GPU required
4. Health endpoints accessible from host machine
5. Development setup documented in README

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create Dockerfile for FastAPI server (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Use appropriate Python base image (CPU-only)
  - [ ] Install FastAPI, uvicorn, and required dependencies
  - [ ] Set up proper working directory and file permissions
  - [ ] Configure server to run on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- [ ] Task 2: Create docker-compose.yml for development (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Define server service with proper port mapping
  - [ ] Add volume mounts for development code
  - [ ] Configure environment variables for local development
  - [ ] Set up proper networking between services
- [ ] Task 3: Add development configuration (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create .env.example with required environment variables
  - [ ] Add development-specific configuration options
  - [ ] Set up proper logging configuration
  - [ ] Configure CORS for local development
- [ ] Task 4: Create README with setup instructions (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Document Docker installation requirements
  - [ ] Provide step-by-step setup instructions
  - [ ] Include troubleshooting section
  - [ ] Add examples for common development tasks
- [ ] Task 5: Add development tooling (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create Makefile or scripts for common tasks
  - [ ] Add development database setup (if needed)
  - [ ] Include code formatting and linting setup
  - [ ] Add pre-commit hooks configuration

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.3 provide the core server and desktop functionality. This story adds containerization and development tooling.

### Data Models
No specific data models required - this is infrastructure setup.

### API Specifications
**Health Endpoints** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#health-info]:
- `/v1/healthz` - must be accessible from host machine
- `/v1/server/info` - server information endpoint

### File Locations
**Infrastructure** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#deployment-units]:
- Server Container (CUDA base) - Dockerfile for containerization
- Config & Secrets - environment variables for paths and settings

**Development Setup** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#environments]:
- Local dev (CPU, fake previews) - Docker setup for development

### Technical Constraints
**Runtime Requirements** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- Must run on CPU for MVP (no GPU required)
- Local development environment setup

**Security** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#security]:
- HTTPS ready (TLS termination at reverse proxy)
- Proper CORS configuration for development

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Docker build and run testing
- Health endpoint accessibility testing
- Development workflow validation
