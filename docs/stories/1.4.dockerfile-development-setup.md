  - [x] Add pre-commit hooks configuration

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.3 provide the core server and desktop functionality. This story adds containerization and development tooling.

### Data Models
No specific data models required - this is infrastructure setup.

### API Specifications
**Health Endpoints** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#health-info]:
- `/v1/healthz` - must be accessible from host machine
- `/v1/server/info` - server information endpoint

### File Locations
**Infrastructure** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#deployment-units]:
- Server Container (CUDA base) - Dockerfile for containerization
- Config & Secrets - environment variables for paths and settings

**Development Setup** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#environments]:
- Local dev (CPU, fake previews) - Docker setup for development

### Technical Constraints
**Runtime Requirements** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- Must run on CPU for MVP (no GPU required)
- Local development environment setup

**Security** [Source: architecture/7-api-specifications.md#security]:
- HTTPS ready (TLS termination at reverse proxy)
- Proper CORS configuration for development

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Docker build and run testing
- Health endpoint accessibility testing
- Development workflow validation

- ✅ Configured non-root user for security
- ✅ Created docker-compose.yml with proper port mapping and volume mounts
- ✅ Added .env.example with comprehensive configuration options
- ✅ Updated README.md with detailed Docker setup instructions
- ✅ Added troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
- ✅ Created Makefile with common development commands
- ✅ Created dev.py script for automated development workflow
- ✅ Added requests dependency to requirements.txt for dev script

### File List
- Dockerfile (new)
- docker-compose.yml (new)
- .env.example (new)
- README.md (modified)
- Makefile (new)
- dev.py (new)
- requirements.txt (modified - added requests dependency)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - The implementation demonstrates high-quality Docker containerization and development tooling. All acceptance criteria are fully met with comprehensive documentation and robust development workflows. The code follows best practices for containerization, security, and maintainability.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: Dockerfile
  - **Change**: Added PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR and PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK environment variables
  - **Why**: Improves build performance and reduces image size
  - **How**: Prevents pip from caching packages and checking versions unnecessarily

- **File**: Dockerfile  
  - **Change**: Added apt-get clean to system dependencies installation
  - **Why**: Reduces Docker image size by cleaning package cache
  - **How**: Removes apt package cache after installation

- **File**: dev.py
  - **Change**: Enhanced run_command function with timeout and better exception handling
  - **Why**: Prevents hanging processes and provides clearer error messages
  - **How**: Added 5-minute timeout and comprehensive exception handling

- **File**: .dockerignore (new)
  - **Change**: Created comprehensive .dockerignore file
  - **Why**: Excludes unnecessary files from Docker build context, improving build speed and security
  - **How**: Prevents sensitive files and development artifacts from being included in Docker image

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to Docker best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Well-organized with clear separation of concerns
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Appropriate for infrastructure setup (health checks, integration tests)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced Dockerfile with better environment variables and cleanup
- [x] Improved dev.py script error handling and timeout management
- [x] Added comprehensive .dockerignore file for build optimization
- [x] Validated all Docker configurations and health checks
- [x] Verified development workflow completeness

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** - Security implementation is solid:
- Non-root user configured in Dockerfile
- No secrets or sensitive data in code
- Proper file permissions and ownership
- CORS properly configured for development
- Health checks implemented for monitoring

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS** - Performance optimizations implemented:
- Multi-layer Docker caching strategy
- Slim Python base image (CPU-only)
- Efficient pip installation with no-cache-dir
- Optimized build context with .dockerignore
- Appropriate health check intervals

### Files Modified During Review

- Dockerfile (enhanced with better environment variables and cleanup)
- dev.py (improved error handling and timeout management)
- .dockerignore (new file for build optimization)

*Note: Dev should update File List to include .dockerignore*

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.4-dockerfile-development-setup.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/1.4-risk-20250127.md
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/1.4-nfr-20250127.md

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done** - All acceptance criteria met with high-quality implementation. Minor improvements made during review enhance the overall quality without requiring additional work.
