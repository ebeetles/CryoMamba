# Story 1.2: Scaffold Napari Desktop Application

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a basic napari desktop application with Qt menus and .mrc file loading,
**so that** I have a foundation for the visualization interface

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Desktop can open `.mrc` files and display metadata
2. Qt menus and dialogs are functional
3. napari viewer launches with 3D volume visualization
4. Application runs on macOS without GPU requirements
5. Basic project structure follows architecture specifications

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create napari plugin project structure (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Initialize napari plugin using cookiecutter template
  - [ ] Create `napari_cryomamba/` package structure
  - [ ] Set up `pyproject.toml` with napari plugin entry points
  - [ ] Create basic `__init__.py` with plugin registration
- [ ] Task 2: Implement Qt menu system (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create main menu bar with File, View, Help menus
  - [ ] Implement File > Open dialog for .mrc files
  - [ ] Add View menu for 2D/3D toggle and rendering options
  - [ ] Create Help menu with About dialog
- [ ] Task 3: Implement .mrc file loading (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create `.mrc` file reader using `mrcfile` library
  - [ ] Add file validation and error handling
  - [ ] Display volume metadata in status bar or info panel
  - [ ] Support both 2D and 3D visualization modes
- [ ] Task 4: Create napari viewer integration (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Initialize napari viewer with proper configuration
  - [ ] Add volume as Image layer with appropriate rendering
  - [ ] Implement layer controls for opacity and colormap
  - [ ] Add 3D visualization toggle functionality
- [ ] Task 5: Add development setup (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with napari and Qt dependencies
  - [ ] Add development installation instructions
  - [ ] Create basic README with usage examples
  - [ ] Test installation and basic functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 provides the FastAPI server foundation. This story builds the desktop client that will connect to that server.

### Data Models
**Volume Metadata** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#volume-metadata]:
- Includes filename, shape, voxel_size, intensity stats
- Should be displayed in UI for user reference

### API Specifications
**Desktop Application** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#21-desktop-application]:
- UI: Qt menus, dialogs, status bar
- Visualization: napari (3D volume, labels overlays)
- I/O: `mrcfile` for reading/writing
- Data Structures: Volume object, JobConfig, Mask overlay layers

### File Locations
**Desktop Application Structure** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#21-desktop-application]:
- UI components in Qt-based widgets
- napari integration for 3D visualization
- File I/O using `mrcfile` library

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#deployment-units]:
- Desktop Packaging (PyInstaller .app) - for future packaging

### Technical Constraints
**Runtime Requirements** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- Must run on CPU for MVP (no GPU required)
- macOS compatibility required
- napari + Qt integration

**Performance** [Source: architecture/6-runtime-design-concurrency.md#desktop]:
- Desktop remains ≥30 FPS on typical 512³ volumes
- Efficient memory management for large volumes

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Unit tests for file loading and UI components
- Integration tests for napari viewer functionality
- Manual testing on macOS
