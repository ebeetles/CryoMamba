## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 provides the FastAPI server foundation. This story builds the desktop client that will connect to that server.

### Data Models
**Volume Metadata** [Source: architecture/4-data-models-schemas.md#volume-metadata]:
- Includes filename, shape, voxel_size, intensity stats
- Should be displayed in UI for user reference

### API Specifications
**Desktop Application** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#21-desktop-application]:
- UI: Qt menus, dialogs, status bar
- Visualization: napari (3D volume, labels overlays)
- I/O: `mrcfile` for reading/writing
- Data Structures: Volume object, JobConfig, Mask overlay layers

### File Locations
**Desktop Application Structure** [Source: architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#21-desktop-application]:
- UI components in Qt-based widgets
- napari integration for 3D visualization
- File I/O using `mrcfile` library

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#deployment-units]:
- Desktop Packaging (PyInstaller .app) - for future packaging

### Technical Constraints
**Runtime Requirements** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#resources]:
- Must run on CPU for MVP (no GPU required)
- macOS compatibility required
- napari + Qt integration

**Performance** [Source: architecture/6-runtime-design-concurrency.md#desktop]:
- Desktop remains ≥30 FPS on typical 512³ volumes
- Efficient memory management for large volumes

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md#observability]:
- Unit tests for file loading and UI components
- Integration tests for napari viewer functionality
- Manual testing on macOS

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (via Cursor)

### Debug Log References
- Created napari plugin package structure with proper src-layout
- Fixed pyproject.toml to remove setuptools-scm dependency for standalone installation
- Implemented Qt widget with proper context manager support for testing
- All tests passing successfully

### Completion Notes List
- Successfully created napari plugin with proper package structure
- Implemented CryoMambaWidget with Qt-based UI for .mrc file loading
- Added volume metadata display and 3D visualization toggle
- Created comprehensive test suite with proper Qt application setup
- Verified installation and basic functionality works on macOS

### File List
- `napari_cryomamba/napari_cryomamba/__init__.py` - Plugin registration and entry points
- `napari_cryomamba/napari_cryomamba/widget.py` - Main CryoMamba widget implementation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality with comprehensive error handling, proper separation of concerns, and clean architecture. The napari plugin follows best practices for Qt widget development and provides a solid foundation for the CryoMamba desktop application.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `napari_cryomamba/napari_cryomamba/widget.py`
  - **Change**: Enhanced error handling in `load_mrc_file()` method with data validation
  - **Why**: Prevents crashes from empty or corrupted MRC files
  - **How**: Added try-catch blocks, data size validation, and proper UI state reset on errors

- **File**: `napari_cryomamba/napari_cryomamba/widget.py`
  - **Change**: Added `clear_volume()` method and "Clear Volume" button
  - **Why**: Improves user experience by allowing volume cleanup
  - **How**: Provides proper state management and UI reset functionality

- **File**: `napari_cryomamba/napari_cryomamba/widget.py`
  - **Change**: Enhanced `toggle_3d_view()` method with better button text feedback
  - **Why**: Improves user experience with clear visual feedback
  - **How**: Dynamic button text updates based on current rendering mode

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Clean, well-documented code following Python conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper napari plugin structure with src-layout
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with proper Qt application setup
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced error handling for MRC file loading (widget.py:78-115)
- [x] Added clear volume functionality (widget.py:149-159)
- [x] Improved 3D toggle user feedback (widget.py:161-178)
- [x] Added data validation for empty files (widget.py:84-86)
- [ ] Consider adding progress indicators for large file loading
- [ ] Add support for multiple volume layers
- [ ] Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Desktop application with local file access only. No network communication or external dependencies that could introduce vulnerabilities.

### Performance Considerations

Good performance characteristics with efficient memory management. Data copying is appropriate for napari integration. Consider adding progress indicators for very large files (>1GB) in future iterations.

### Files Modified During Review

- `napari_cryomamba/napari_cryomamba/widget.py` - Enhanced error handling and UI improvements

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.2-scaffold-napari-desktop.yml
Risk profile: Low risk - foundation story with no critical dependencies
NFR assessment: All non-functional requirements met

### Recommended Status
